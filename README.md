# Installations
•	The project has been done in the Anaconda environment with python 3.6 been done in the Anaconda environment with python 3.6

•	https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling - installed using pip. The pandas profiling reports gives a quick way to gaine some more exploratory data analysis than the pandas describe() function   

# Motivation
This project has been conducted as part of Udacity's Data Scientists Nanodegree. Three business question should be answered related to a selected dataset. This project covers some Wine Analysis using the public dataset from Kaggle: www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.

•	Question 1: Are there differences in the winiewers description for the best rated wines according to the least rated wines?

•	Question 2: What are the best rated wines in different price categories?

•	Question 3: What kind of grapes make the best wine?

# Summary
Ratings on the scale 50-100 are commonly used in reviews of wines. The descriptions of the top five wines includes more “advanced” descriptions like; texture, complex , concentrated and character. For wines at the lower end of the scale, they are more often described with terms such as finish, flavor, palate, green and fresh.

For under $20 you can buy several wine that wine rated over 90 points, eg. for $13 you can buy the wine Rulo 2007 Syrah from US which is rated 94 points. For $80 you can select between the US produced wines Charles Smith 2006 Royal City Syra and Cayuse 2008 Bionic Frog Syrah, both rated 100 points.  When it comes to wine grapes, there are several thousand types of varieties around the world. Again using the data for the highest rated wines that scores above 95 points, the graph show that the top three varieties are Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bordeaux-style Red Blend.
